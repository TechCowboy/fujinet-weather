### Apple2
 - June 2024
   - move build/makefile over to fenrocks makefile system
   - adjusted BSS to fit in space allocated


# Building on Platforms

### Atari
- need the Mad-Pascal (MP) 32-bit Turbo Pascal compiler - https://mads.atari8.info/doc/en/index.html
- no more info currently


### ADAM
- need zcc compiler for ADAM.
  - https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki



### Apple2
- cc65 & fn-libs (pulled automatically) are used to build the Apple2

  - git clone https://github.com/cc65/cc65.git
  - make clean && make PREFIX=/usr/local && sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
  - Verify with this command:
    - cl65 --print-target-path


### c64
- cc65 is used to build for the C64
  - See Apple2 above for cc65 installations


### Coco
- Color Computer builds with CMOC - CMOC is a 6809-generating cross-compiler for a large subset of the C language
  - http://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/cmoc.html
    - download lwtools, make, make install
      - http://www.lwtools.ca/releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.22.tar.gz
    - download cmoc, make, make install
      - http://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/cmoc-0.1.86.tar.gz



### VIC-20
- cc65 is used to build for the VIC
  - See Apple2 above for cc65 installations


# Usage and Application Notes

### Apple 2
- Apple2 builds fine but it requires a API key from OpenWeatherMap
  - https://home.openweathermap.org
  - You need to setup an account, request on-by-one and get an API Key
  - You then must upgrade that key to be "Base Plan" - which is free for first 1000 calls
    - you will need to register your name a credit card to get the plan

 This isn't optimal but it's what required right now in June 2024, other API plans will be explored.

  - Put the contents of the KEY (32 bytes long) into a file named '56000101.key'.
  - Save the file in the /FujiNet directory of your Fujinet SD card.
    - full path would be: SD/FujiNet/56000101.key
    - Note capitalization


 ## Other Platforms

 Work as expected...
